        <h1>Scenario 2</h1>
        <div id="story" class="content">
            <p>ðŸ’¬ Someone new comments on your post, complimenting your fashion style. You start chatting to them in a friendly way. After a few weeks, they suggest meeting up in person at a shopping centre. What do you do?</p>
            <button onclick="showSection('A')">Say yes and agree to meet them alone.</button>
            <button onclick="showSection('B')">Agree to meet but tell a trusted adult and bring someone with you.</button>
        </div>
        
        <div id="A" class="content hidden">
            <ul>
                <li>You donâ€™t tell anyone and arrange to meet them in a shopping centre.</li>
                <li>When you arrive, you notice they look older than they said they were.</li>
                <li>You feel like something isnâ€™t right, but youâ€™re already here.</li>
                <li>Next step: what do you do now?</li>
            </ul>
            <button onclick="showSection('AA')">Stay and go ahead with the meeting.</button>
            <button onclick="showSection('AB')">Make an excuse and leave.</button>
            <button onclick="showSection('story')">Back</button>
        </div>
        
        <div id="AA" class="content hidden">
            <ul>
                <li>You convince yourself youâ€™re overreacting. They seem nice enough, so you start chatting.</li>
                <li>After a while, they suggest going somewhere quieter, away from the crowd.</li>
                <li>ðŸ˜¬ Now you feel uncomfortable. You donâ€™t want to leave the public shopping centre with them. You make up an excuse and leave.</li>
                <li>ðŸ¤” Lesson: Meeting alone was a risky decision. If something feels off, it probably is. Never be afraid to leave a situation that makes you uncomfortable.</li>
                <li>ðŸ”„ Go back and choose again?</li>
            </ul>
            <button onclick="showSection('A')">Back</button>
        </div>
        
        <div id="AB" class="content hidden">
            <ul>
                <li>You feel something is off, so you say you have to leave and walk quickly toward a crowded area.</li>
                <li>Later, you tell a friend what happened. They help you check the personâ€™s profile again and you notice they do NOT have many tagged posts â€“ this could be a ðŸš¨ red flag.</li>
                <li>ðŸŽ‰ You made a safer choice!</li>
                <li>ðŸ¤” Lesson: Trusting your instincts was the responsible thing to do! Meeting alone is risky, and itâ€™s always best to have a trusted adult aware of your plans.</li>
                <li>ðŸ”„ Go back and choose again?</li>
            </ul>
            <button onclick="showSection('A')">Back</button>
        </div>
        
        <div id="B" class="content hidden">
            <ul>
                <li>You ask a trusted adult like a parent or older sibling if itâ€™s okay to meet up.</li>
                <li>They suggest a safer approach: bringing someone with you and meeting in a public cafÃ© instead of a quiet part of the shopping centre.</li>
                <li>Your older sibling comes with you, and when you meet the person, they seem normal.</li>
                <li>The meetup goes fine! But now they ask to hang out again â€“ this time, JUST  the two of you.</li>
                <li>Next step: what do you do now?</li>
            </ul>
            <button onclick="showSection('BA')">Say yes to the second meetup alone.</button>
            <button onclick="showSection('BB')">Politely decline and suggest meeting in a group again.</button>
            <button onclick="showSection('story')">Back</button>
        </div>
        
        <div id="BA" class="content hidden">
            <ul>
                <li>They seemed fine the first time, so you agree to meet alone next time.</li>
                <li>This time, they are more forward and ask personal questions â€“ where you live, what time youâ€™re usually home, if your parents work late.</li>
                <li>ðŸ˜¬ Now you feel uncomfortable. You donâ€™t want to answer their questions. You make up an excuse and leave.</li>
                <li>ðŸ¤” Lesson: Even if someone seems safe at first, you still donâ€™t really know them. Some people who do NOT have good intentions may try to build trust first.</li>
                <li>ðŸ”„ Go back and choose again?</li>
            </ul>
            <button onclick="showSection('B')">Back</button>
        </div>
        
        <div id="BB" class="content hidden">
            <ul>
                <li>You say youâ€™d rather keep meeting in a group.</li>
                <li>If they respect that, great! But if they push you to meet alone, you say NO.</li>
                <li>ðŸ¤” Lesson: If someone is pushing you to do something you arenâ€™t comfortable with, thatâ€™s a ðŸš¨ red flag. Real friends respect your boundaries.</li>
                <li>Next step: what do you do now?</li>
            </ul>
            <button onclick="showSection('BBA')">Keep talking to them online anyway.</button>
            <button onclick="showSection('BBB')">Stop talking to them and block them if necessary.</button>
            <button onclick="showSection('B')">Back</button>
        </div>
        
        <div id="BBA" class="content hidden">
            <ul>
                <li>You decide to keep chatting but avoid meeting in person.</li>
                <li>They get upset that you do NOT want to meet up and blame you for being paranoid.</li>
                <li>Over time, they start messaging you more, getting upset when you donâ€™t reply quickly. They even start trying to call you.</li>
                <li>They ask you to prove that they can trust you by sharing a secret and sending photos.</li>
                <li>ðŸ˜¬ The messages make you feel uncomfortable. You donâ€™t want to answer their questions.</li>
                <li>ðŸ¤” Lesson: If someone gets upset about your boundaries, thatâ€™s a ðŸš¨ red flag. You donâ€™t owe anyone your time, trust, or personal information.</li>
                <li>ðŸ”„ Go back and choose again?</li>
            </ul>

        <div id="BBB" class="content hidden">
            <ul>
                <li>You do NOT feel comfortable that they keep pushing to meet alone and decide to stop talking to them.</li>
                        <li>You block them if they keep pressuring you.</li>
                        <li>Later, you learn they had been messaging other people in the same way, trying to build friendships and getting people to meet alone.</li>
                        <li>ðŸŽ‰ You made a safer choice!</li>
                        <li>ðŸ¤” Lesson: If something feels off, itâ€™s okay to step away. Online friendships can be real, but safety comes first.</li>
                <li>ðŸ”„ Go back and choose again?</li>
