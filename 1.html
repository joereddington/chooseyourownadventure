        <h1>Scenario 1</h1>
        <div id="story" class="content">
            <p>ðŸ’¬ You receive a message from someone claiming to be a site moderator. They tell you your account is about to be banned due to a mix-up and urge you to click a link immediately to fix it. What do you do?</p>
            <button onclick="showSection('A')">Click the link right away â€“ this sounds serious!</button>
            <button onclick="showSection('B')">Donâ€™t click the link and instead check the siteâ€™s official help page.</button>
        </div>
        
        <div id="A" class="content hidden">
            <ul>
                <li>The link takes you to a page that looks exactly like the real siteâ€™s login page. You enter your details and submit.</li>
                <li>A few hours later, you try logging in, but your password doesnâ€™t work.</li>
            <li>ðŸ˜¬ Oh NO! Your account has been hacked!
            <li>ðŸ¤” Lesson: This was a phishing scam. The message pressured you to act fast, and the link led to a fake site. Urgent messages can be a ðŸš¨ red flag. Always go directly to the real website instead of clicking links in messages. Never enter personal details on a page you didnâ€™t navigate to yourself.
            </ul>
            <button onclick="showSection('AA')">Do nothing and hope it gets fixed on its own.</button>
            <button onclick="showSection('AB')">Ask an adult for advice and try to reset your password.</button>
            <button onclick="showSection('story')">Back</button>
        </div>
        
        <div id="AA" class="content hidden">
            <ul>
                <li>Days go by and you still canâ€™t log in.</li>
                <li>You start hearing from friends that your account is sending weird messages. Some of your friends think you are scamming them!</li>
            <li>ðŸ˜¬ Now youâ€™re NOT JUST  locked out â€“ youâ€™ve lost control of your online identity.</p>
            <li>ðŸ”„ Go back and choose again?</p>
            </ul>
            <button onclick="showSection('A')">Back</button>
        </div>
        
        <div id="AB" class="content hidden">
            <ul>
                <li>You tell a parent or teacher what happened. They help you visit the real website to try resetting your password.</li>
                <li>Luckily, you had two-factor authentication enabled. You use this to regain access before too much damage is done.</li>
                <li>You quickly change your password to something stronger and report the scam to the platform.</li>
            <li>ðŸŽ‰ Success! You recovered your account! But what could have happened if the hacker had sent messages pretending to be you?</p>
            <li>ðŸ¤” Lesson: Always think before clicking, and make sure your accounts have extra security like two-factor authentication.</p>
            </ul>

        <div id="B" class="content hidden">
            <ul>
                <li>You stop and think before clicking. You decide to check the siteâ€™s official help page.</li>
                <li>It doesnâ€™t have any alerts about this issue.</li>
                <li>You message a friend to ask if theyâ€™ve had the same problem and they havenâ€™t.</li>
            <li>ðŸš¨ This is looking more and more like a phishing scamâ€¦ but what now?</p>
            </ul>
            <button onclick="showSection('BA')">Ignore the message and move on.</button>
            <button onclick="showSection('BB')">Report the message as a scam and warn others.</button>

        <div id="BA" class="content hidden">
            <ul>
                <li>You donâ€™t click the link, but you also donâ€™t do anything else.</li>
                <li>A few days later, the same account messages you again, this time with an even scarier warning.</li>
            <li>ðŸ¤” Lesson: Scammers often try again if they think you might fall for their tricks.</p>
            </ul>
            <button onclick="showSection('B')">Back</button>

                <li>You report the scam message on the site.</li>
                <li>Then you post on your group chat warning your friends that this scam is going around.</li>
            <li>ðŸŽ‰ Smart move! You helped protect others too!</p> 
            </ul>
            <button onclick="showSection('BBA')">Do nothing else â€“ youâ€™ve already reported it.</button>
            <button onclick="showSection('BBB')">Take extra steps to protect your account.</button>

        </div>
         <div id="BBA" class="content hidden">
                  <ul>
                      <li>You feel good about reporting the scam, but you donâ€™t change any of your own security settings.</li>
                      <li>A week later, you get a similar scam message from a different account. This time, they claim your bank account is locked!</li>
                      <li>ðŸ¤” Lesson: Scammers might target people based on weak security settings. Reporting scams is great, but securing your own accounts is even better. Changing passwords and enabling two-factor authentication can stop scammers from targeting you again.</li>
                      <li>ðŸ”„ Go back and choose again?</li>
                  </ul>

                  <ul>
                      <li>After reporting the scam, you decide to review your own account security.</li>
                      <li>You enable two-factor authentication, making it much harder for someone to hack your account.</li>
                      <li>You also change your account password to something stronger â€“ one thatâ€™s different from any other accounts you use.</li>
                      <li>ðŸŽ‰ Great decision! Youâ€™ve taken real action to protect yourself from future scams!</li>
                      <li>ðŸ¤” Lesson: Scam prevention isnâ€™t JUST  about avoiding scams! Itâ€™s also about making sure your accounts are as secure as possible. What else could you do to keep your personal information safe online?</li>
